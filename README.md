# Project-1-Battle-Ship

This game that I am working on is going to be BattleShip! 

The game of BattleShip is going to have to players that are going set their ship on their own desired location on the board and take turns attcking each other's ship. Once one player's ship are all destroyed on the board that player loses the game. 




MVP Goals

- naming feature for user 
- creating a gameboard 
- Being able attack the opponent 
- being able to be attacked by opponent
- Having a turn by turn system 
- creating a message board telling the user if the attack was successful or not 
- coding in the spaces that have already been attacked so you don't attack the same spaces 
- being able to set your own ships anywhere on your board before the game starts 
- once all ships are set creating a start game feature to begin the game.
